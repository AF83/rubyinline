Ruby Inline

DESCRIPTION:
  
Ruby Inline is my quick attempt to create an analog to Perl's
Inline::C. The ruby version isn't near as feature-full as the perl
version, but it is neat!
  
FEATURES:
  
+ Quick and easy inlining of your C code embedded in your ruby script.
- Currently doesn't munge ruby names that aren't compatible in C (ex: a!())

REQUIREMENTS:

+ Ruby - 1.6.7 has been used, but not formally tested.

INSTALL:

+ no install instructions yet.
